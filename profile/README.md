If you aren't very experienced with github or programming yet, check out this quick <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/184nnZfxyJerUVU_V218xf5mTuo9j3KJdPNPttHNWlRk/edit?usp=sharing">Introduction to Github and VSCode</a> to get started.

##üåà Contribution guidelines - Please feel free to start at whatever pace works best for you. We have a test repisotory in this organization where you can practice making a branch, merging, etc. If you have any questions, please feel free to DM George or ask in the gigachad-coders chat. If you want to work on a project, feel free. If you can, please make your changes on a branch -- but it's not a requirement. It will just make it easier to keep your mess off everyone else's plate until you're ready for show-and-tell.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
 how can the community get involved?
 - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
