## 🌈 Contribution guidelines 
Please feel free to start at whatever pace works best for you. We have a test repisotory in this organization where you can practice making a branch, merging, etc. If you have any questions, please feel free to DM George or ask in the gigachad-coders chat. If you want to work on a project, feel free. If you can, please make your changes on a branch -- but it's not a requirement. It will just make it easier to keep your mess off everyone else's plate until you're ready for show-and-tell.
